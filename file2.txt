cp    : If the last argument names an existing directory, cp copies each other given file into a file with the same name in that directory. Otherwise, if only two files are given, it copies the first onto the second. It is an error if the last argument is not a directory and more than two files are given. By default, it does not copy directories.
cat   : Concatenate files and print on the standard output.
more  : Let us display and scroll down the output in one direction only. You can scroll page by page or line by line.

It can move only regular files across file systems. If a destination file is unwritable, the standard input is a tty, and the â€“f or --force option is not given, mv prompts the user for whether to overwrite the file. If the response does not begin with y or Y, the file is skipped.

If a file is unwritable, the standard input is a tty, and the -f or --force option is not given, rm prompts the user for whether to remove the file.
