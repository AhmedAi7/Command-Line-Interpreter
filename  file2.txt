cd    : This command changes the current directory to another one.
ls    : These programs list each given file or directory name. Directory contents are sorted alphabetically. For ls, files are by default listed in columns, sorted vertically, if the standard output is a terminal; otherwise, they are listed one per line.
cp    : If the last argument names an existing directory, cp copies each other given file into a file with the same name in that directory. Otherwise, if only two files are given, it copies the first onto the second. It is an error if the last argument is not a directory and more than two files are given. By default, it does not copy directories.
cat   : Concatenate files and print on the standard output.
more  : Let us display and scroll down the output in one direction only. You can scroll page by page or line by line.
|     : Use pipes â€œ | â€œ to redirect the output of the previous command as in input to another command.

Otherwise, if only two files are given, it moves the first onto the second. It is an error if the last argument is not a directory and more than two files are given. It can move only regular files across file systems. If a destination file is unwritable, the standard input is a tty, and the â€“f or --force option is not given, mv prompts the user for whether to overwrite the file. If the response does not begin with y or Y, the file is skipped.
rm    : rm removes each specified file. By default, it does not remove directories. If a file is unwritable, the standard input is a tty, and the -f or --force option is not given, rm prompts the user for whether to remove the file.
